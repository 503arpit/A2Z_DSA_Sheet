# 📘 A2Z DSA Sheet Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing solutions to the **[Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-dsa-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)**.  
This repo is a reflection of my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey**, where I solve problems step by step, topic by topic, while building strong problem-solving skills.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen **core DSA concepts** (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)
- Build **consistency and discipline** by solving problems daily
- Prepare effectively for **coding interviews & placements**
